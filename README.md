# What is this?
This is a terminal interface to use [gpt 4 for free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free) from the terminal.

# Why did you make it
Because i don't really want to run a whole webapp just to get and receive text, it just uses too much ram (100 mb) for nothing really.

# Whats the features?
- can use from the terminal
- gpt-4 but for free
- will render markdown in the terminal just fine
- has internet acess

# Alright! how do i use this?
- clone the repo
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `python main.py`
